**PARANO!A is a game made for DayDream-Delhi, A Game jam hosted in over 100+ cities, on the Theme: Sacrifices Must Be Made**

Evan, an individual suffering from a mental disorder which causes immense fear of death, always feels threatened by his surroundings. Even a leaf falling is more than enough to scare him to death. This game consists of 3 Levels, all having unique difficulties.

- **First Level:** Evan has to cross the street, but there are a massive amount of cars travelling down the street. He has a few stones that he can throw to stop a car, but that's it.
- **Second Level:** He travels down the subway, but he notices a person carrying a knife. He blends into the crowd like a regular person. You have to flag and kill him before he kills you, but innocents die in between too!
- **Last Level:** You have to make a grave choice between Fear and Life which affects Evan's future...

This game not only requires sacrifices in game, but also in real life, where a person must sacrifice his sanity and muster his patience to be able to pass the test.

### Difficulties faced:
- The most difficult part was the assets because everything requires creativity.
- The bugs faced were also a big problem but we managed to overcome them
